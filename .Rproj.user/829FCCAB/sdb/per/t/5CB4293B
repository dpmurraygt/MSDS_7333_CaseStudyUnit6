Which of these two MAC addresses should be used and which should not be used for RTLS? Which MAC address yields the best prediction of location?  Does using data for both MAC addresses simultaneously yield more, or less, accurate prediction of location? (Note: this portion is derived from Exercise Q.9 in Nolan and Lang.)\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggthemes)\n\n```\n\n\nThis sounds like we are trying to compare three different modeling methods for location finding:\n1.  Keep 00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0 and to eliminate the data corresponding to MAC address 00:0f:a3:39:dd:cd. \n2.  Drop 00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0 and to keep the data corresponding to MAC address 00:0f:a3:39:dd:cd. \n3.  Keep both\n\nOur evaluation criteria needs to speak to accuracy - which I would interpret as a higher confidence in the predictions - so having a smaller confidence interval band.\n\nWe know our location\nWe figured out the location of the access points.  Two are at the same location.  One was left out of the analysis.\nCould probably describe the location of access points \nWe know relationships of access points, test locations, signal strengths\n\n\nSignal Strength = angle + distance(x, y)\n\n```{r}\nlist <- c(\"00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0\", \"00:0f:a3:39:dd:cd\")\n\noffline %>% mutate(signal = as.numeric(signal)) %>% filter(mac %in% list) %>% ggplot(aes(x=signal)) + geom_histogram() + theme_light() + facet_wrap(~mac, ncol=2)\n\n```\n```{r}\noffline %>% ggplot(aes(x=posX, y=posY)) + geom_point(alpha=0.05) + theme_light() + facet_grid(~mac)+ geom_jitter()\n\n```\n#Heatmap of each of the two options\n```{r}\n\nparCur = par(mfrow = c(4,2), mar = rep(1, 4)) \n\nmapply(surfaceSS, mac = \"00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0\", angle = rep(c(0, 135,180, 270), 2), data = list(data = offlineSummary))\n\npar(parCur)\n\n#Nolan, Deborah; Lang, Duncan Temple.

Kindle Edition. \n\n```\n\n```{r}\n#This is the one that was dropped\ncompareMacList <- c(\"00:0f:a3:39:dd:cd\", \"00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0\")\nofflineSummary2 = do.call(\"rbind\", signalSummary)     \n\nparCur = par(mfrow = c(2,2), mar = rep(1, 4)) \n\nmapply(surfaceSS, mac = compareMacList[rep(c(1,2), each=2)], angle = rep(c(90, 135), 2), data = list(data = offlineSummary2))\n\npar(parCur)\n\n#surfaceSS(mac=\"00:0f:a3:39:e1:c0\", angle = 180, data = offlineSummary2)\n\n#Nolan, Deborah; Lang, Duncan Temple.

Kindle Edition. \n\nunique(offlineSummary2$orientation)\n\n```\nThe access point that was eliminated, shown on the bottom, seems to have some greater uncertainty associated with it. While there's a zone of uncertainty associated with the first, it has a higher degree of certainty and strength of signal close to the suspected base.  \n\n#Keep e1:c0\n```{r}\n\n\n```\n\n\n#Keep dd:cd\n```{r}\n\n\n```\n\n#Keep Both Data\n```{r}\n\n\n```",
